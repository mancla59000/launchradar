# Active Mode Configuration - LaunchRadar

## Selected Mode: Full BMAD

### Decision Date
2024-08-01

### Complexity Score
10/12 (High Complexity)

### Justification
The LaunchRadar project requires Full BMAD mode due to:

1. **Technical Complexity (3/3)**
   - 9+ technologies requiring complex integrations
   - Multiple API dependencies (Twitter, Reddit, Stripe)
   - Advanced data processing and AI scoring algorithms

2. **Timeline Complexity (3/3)**
   - Estimated 2-3 months development
   - Multiple phases of implementation required
   - Complex business intelligence features

3. **Domain Expertise (3/3)**
   - Business intelligence specialization required
   - AI/ML algorithm development
   - Economic trend analysis expertise
   - Market opportunity identification

## Activated Workflow

### Phase 1 - Planning (ACTIVE)
**Orchestrator:** planning-orchestrator
**Active Agents:**
- business-analyst (market analysis, user stories)
- solution-architect (technical architecture, design patterns)

**Deliverables:**
- Project Brief Document
- Technical Architecture Document
- API Integration Strategy
- Data Pipeline Design
- Security Requirements

### Phase 2 - Development (QUEUED)
**Orchestrator:** development-orchestrator
**Agents to Activate:**
- frontend-specialist (Next.js implementation)
- backend-specialist (Supabase integration)
- data-engineer (scraping & processing)

### Phase 3 - Quality (QUEUED)
**Orchestrator:** quality-orchestrator
**Agents to Activate:**
- security-auditor (API security, data protection)
- performance-optimizer (scalability, efficiency)
- test-engineer (integration testing)

## Next Steps
1. Activate Planning Orchestrator
2. Begin business analysis with market research
3. Design technical architecture
4. Create detailed project brief
5. Validate planning phase deliverables before development handoff
